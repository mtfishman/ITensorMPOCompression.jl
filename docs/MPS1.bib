	title = {Foundations of quantum physics {IV}. {More} on the thermal interpretation},
	abstract = {This paper continues the discussion of the thermal interpretation of quantum physics. While Part II and Part III of this series of papers explained and justified the reasons for the departure from tradition, the present Part IV summarizes the main features and adds intuitive explanations and new technical developments. It is shown how the spectral features of quantum systems and an approximate classical dynamics arise under appropriate conditions. Evidence is given for how, in the thermal interpretation, the measurement of a qubit by a pointer q-expectation may result in a binary detection event with probabilities given by the diagonal entries of the reduced density matrix of the prepared qubit. Differences in the conventions about measurement errors in the thermal interpretation and in traditional interpretations are discussed in detail. Several standard experiments, the double slit, Stern–Gerlach, and particle decay are described from the perspective of the thermal interpretation.},

	title = {Foundations of quantum physics {I}. {A} critique of the tradition},
	abstract = {This paper gives a thorough critique of the foundations of quantum physics in its mainstream interpretation (i.e., treating pure states as primitives, without reference to hidden variables, and without modifications of the quantum laws). This is achieved by cleanly separating a concise version of the (universally accepted) formal core of quantum physics from the (controversial) interpretation issues. The latter are primarily related to measurement, but also to questions of existence and of the meaning of basic concepts like 'state' and 'particle'. The requirements for good foundations of quantum physics are discussed. Main results: * Born's rule cannot be valid universally, and must be considered as a scientific law with a restricted domain of validity. * If the state of every composite quantum system contains all information that can be known about this system, it cannot be a pure state in general.},

	title = {Foundations of quantum physics {III}. {Measurement}},
	abstract = {This paper presents the measurement problem from the point of view of the thermal interpretation of quantum physics introduced in Part II. The measurement of a Hermitian quantity \$A\$ is regarded as giving an uncertain value approximating the q-expectation \${\textbackslash}langle A{\textbackslash}rangle\$ rather than (as tradition wanted to have it) as an exact revelation of an eigenvalue of \$A\$. Single observations of microscopic systems are (except under special circumstances) very uncertain measurements only. The thermal interpretation * treats detection events as a statistical measurement of particle beam intensity. * claims that the particle concept is only asymptotically valid, under conditions where particles are essentially free. * claims that the unmodeled environment influences the results enough to cause all randomness in quantum physics. * allows one to derive Born's rule for scattering and in the limit of ideal measurements; but in general, only part of Born's rule holds exactly: Whenever a quantity A with zero uncertainty is measured exactly, its value is an eigenvalue of A. * has no explicit collapse – the latter emerges approximately in non-isolated subsystems. * gives a valid interpretation of systems modeled by a quantum-classical dynamics. * explains the peculiar features of the Copenhagen interpretation (lacking realism between measurements) and the minimal statistical interpretation (lacking realism for the single case) where these interpretations apply – in the microscopic domain. The thermal interpretation is an interpretation of quantum physics that is in principle refutable by theoretical arguments leading to a negative answer to a number of open issues collected at the end of the paper, since there is plenty of experimental evidence for each of the points mentioned there.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the thermal interpretation of quantum physics. The insight from Part I of this series that Born's rule has its limitations – hence cannot be the foundation of quantum physics – opens the way for an alternative interpretation – the thermal interpretation of quantum physics. It gives new foundations that connect quantum physics (including quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and their applications) to experiment. The thermal interpretation resolves the problems of the foundations of quantum physics revealed in the critique from Part I of this series. It improves the traditional foundations in several respects: * The thermal interpretation reflects the actual practice of quantum physics, especially regarding its macroscopic implications. * The thermal interpretation gives a fair account of the interpretational differences between quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. * The thermal interpretation gives a natural, realistic meaning to the standard formalism of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in a single world, without introducing additional hidden variables. * The thermal interpretation is independent of the measurement problem. The latter becomes a precise problem in statistical mechanics rather than a fuzzy and problematic notion in the foundations. Details will be discussed in Part III.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

	abstract = {A preparation of ATPase from the membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, solubilized and more than 95\% pure, showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline pH value. The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular dichroism and catalytic properties. Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A large conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about pH = 3.6 (I = 10(-4) M), 4.3 (I = 0.03 M) and 5.3 (I = 0.1 M). The transition was irreversible. Strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of pH. The final product was largely random coil, but even at pH 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete. However, partial dissociation took place at pH 5 (I = 0.028 M). At this pH value the enzyme was inactive, but 20-30\% of the activity could be recovered when the pH was returned to 7.5. In the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition occurred near pH = 11 (I = 0.028 M). The pK of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about 10.9. The unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. Conventional proteolysis did not account for the transformation.},

A crucial ingredient of this algorithm is an efficient transformation for obtaining the matrix elements of the wavefunction as the lattice size is increased, and I introduce here a versatile transformation that is demonstrated to be much more effective than previous versions. The resulting algorithm has a surprisingly close relationship to Vidal's Time Evolving Block Decimation for infinite systems, but allows much faster convergence. Access to a translationally invariant matrix product state allows the calculation of correlation functions based on the transfer matrix, which directly gives the spectrum of all correlation lengths. I also show some advantages of the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) technique for constructing expectation values of higher moments, such as the exact variance $<(H-E)^2>$.},

One application is to represent states in the thermodynamic limit directly, using a small set of position independent matrices. For this infinite MPS ansatz to be useful it is necessary to be able to calculate expectation values, and we show here that a large class of observables, including operators transforming under lattice translations as eigenstates of arbitrary momentum $k$, can be represented in the Schur form of a lower or upper triangular matrix and we present an algorithm for evaluating such expectation values in the asymptotic limit. The sum or the product of two such Schur operators is also a Schur operator, and is easily constructed to give a simple method of constructing arbitrary polynomial combinations of operators. Some simple examples are the variance $\langle (H-E)^2\rangle$ of an infinite MPS, which gives a simple method of evaluating the accuracy of a numerical approximation to a eigenstate, or a vertex operator $\langle c^\dagger_{k_1} c^\dagger_{k_2} c_{k_4} c_{k_3}\rangle$. This approach is a step towards improved algorithms for the calculation of dynamical properties and excited states.},

Just as with area law states, such local operators may be fully specified with a small amount of information per site. Standard matrix product state (MPS) tools are ill-suited to this case, due to extensive Schmidt values that coexist with intensive ones, and Jordan blocks in the transfer matrix. We ameliorate these issues by introducing an "almost Schmidt decomposition" that respects locality. Our method is "$\varepsilon$-close" to the accuracy of MPS-based methods for finite MPOs, and extends seamlessly to the thermodynamic limit, where MPS techniques are inapplicable. In the framework of control theory, our method generalizes Kung's algorithm for model order reduction. Several examples are provided, including an all-MPO version of the operator recursion method (Lanczos algorithm) directly in the thermodynamic limit. All results are accompanied by practical algorithms, well-suited for the large MPOs that arise in DMRG for long-range or quasi-2D models.},

  abstract      = {We investigate the computational power of the recently introduced class of isometric tensor network states (isoTNSs), which generalizes the isometric conditions of the canonical form of one-dimensional matrix-product states to tensor networks in higher dimensions. We discuss several technical details regarding the implementation of isoTNSs-based algorithms and compare different disentanglers -- which are essential for an efficient handling of isoTNSs. We then revisit the time evolving block decimation for isoTNSs ($\text{TEBD}^2$) and explore its power for real time evolution of two-dimensional (2D) lattice systems. Moreover, we introduce a density matrix renormalization group algorithm for isoTNSs ($\text{DMRG}^2$) that allows to variationally find ground states of 2D lattice systems. As a demonstration and benchmark, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor of 2D quantum spin systems for two paradigmatic models: First, we compare our results for the transverse field Ising model on a square lattice with the prediction of the spin-wave theory. Second, we consider the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice and compare it to the result from the exact solution.},

  abstract      = {Tensor network algorithms have been remarkably successful solving a variety of problems in quantum many-body physics. However, algorithms to optimize two-dimensional tensor networks known as PEPS lack many of the aspects that make the seminal density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm so powerful for optimizing one-dimensional tensor networks known as matrix product states. We implement a framework for optimizing two-dimensional PEPS tensor networks which includes all of steps that make DMRG so successful for optimizing one-dimension tensor networks. We present results for several 2D spin models and discuss possible extensions and applications.},
